# Generating Mood-Specific Song Lyrics Using NLP, LSTM and RNN
This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate and analyze song lyrics. It focuses on the generation of lyrics from seed phrases and measures their similarity to existing lyrics categorized by positive and negative sentiments. The project also evaluates various textual properties of the lyrics to understand their complexity and diversity.
# Features:
- Lyric Generation: Generate song lyrics dynamically using seed-based input that guides the thematic direction of the content.
- Textual Analysis: Analyze generated and original lyrics to calculate metrics such as distinct word count, average tokens per lyric, and average line length.
- Cosine Similarity Measurement: Quantify how closely generated lyrics match the original datasets in terms of thematic and emotional content.
- Visualization: Employ visual representations to compare metrics and similarities, providing clear insights into the performance and quality of generated lyrics.

# Results:
The project evaluates the generated lyrics against several metrics and visualizes these metrics to compare against the original lyrics. Results indicate the model's ability to generate lyrics that are both diverse in vocabulary and coherent in structure, closely aligning with the emotional tone of the original dataset.
